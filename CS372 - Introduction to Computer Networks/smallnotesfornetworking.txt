chapter 4 is the transport layer
acronyms
NAT = network area translation
CIDR = Classless InterDomain Routing
DHCP = Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol



chapter 4 includes things like

ip addresses 
subnet information





subnets are determined partially by the /#, for example a /24 would be an ip of 11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000

chapter 5 is the routing methodologies
acronyms
AS = autonomous systems
IGP = interior Gateway Protocol
OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)

chapter 6 is the link layer
acronyms
CRC = cycle reduncency check

mac address = seperate from IP, used to send info to another machine that is physically connected

mac protocols:
partitioning
taking turns
random


TDMA
access channel in 'rounds'
each station gets fixed length

FDMA
each station assigned frequency band
unused transmission time in bands go idle

polling
master invited nodes to transmit in turn, has single point of failure, polling overhead and lots of latency

token passing
token passed around machines, if token, send message, same concerns as polling





slotted aloha = on fixed sync clock, sends signals during sync

pure aloha = sends when recieves

csma/cd and slotted aloha compare like:
csma/cd
1. unsync'd
2. carrier sense - no transmission if others are doing it
3.collision detection
4.random backoff

slotted aloha
1. sync'd
2.no carrier sense
3.no collision detection
4.no random backoff


bit time = time to transmit one bit through 

 csma/cd algorithm
 1. adapter recieve datagram, creates frame
 2. if channel idle for 96 bit time, start the frame transmission
 3. if channel busy, wait until channel idle (plus 96 bit time) to transmit
 4. if transmits without detecting another, adapter is done with frame
 5. if it finds another transmission while transmitting, send 48 bit jam signal
 6. after exiting enters exponential backoff, selects random k, waits k*512 bit times, then returns to step 2
