# R code and explanation for part 4 DA#3.

# Read in the lensdata.csv file.

lensdata = read.csv(file.choose(), header = TRUE)

# Look at the lensdata dataset. Look for the variable names.

head(lensdata) # gives first 6 rows of the data and variable names.

names(lensdata) # gives variable names.

# Make an appropriate visual display for lens thickness.

# Recall hist() or boxplot()

# Add a title.

#already got this covered, dawg

# Add color and other aesthetics if you like.

# See week 3 lessons.

# Calculate the mean and standard deviation. mean() and sd()
mean(lensdata$thickness)
sd(lensdata$thickness)
# Perform a t test using the t.test() command.
t.test(lensdata$thickness, mu = 3.2)
# The format is t.test(data, mu = mu_0, alternative = "alt")

# where data is a quantitative variable mu_0 is the hypothesized mean,

# and alt is either less, greater or not equal (default).
